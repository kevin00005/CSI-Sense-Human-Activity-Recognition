## Trained Model File

The trained CNN model file (`csi_activity_model_final.h5`) is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.

### How to obtain the model:
- The model can be generated by running the training pipeline provided in this repository
- Alternatively, a pre-trained model can be shared upon request

This approach follows standard ML best practices by separating large model artifacts from source code.
